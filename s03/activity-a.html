			<h2>PREAMBLE</h2>
			<p>
				The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of
				abstraction. The clauses that are included in the full version give
				examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as
				software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details
				can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations
				can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the
				details form a cohesive code.
